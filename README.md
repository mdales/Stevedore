Stevedore: Simple local docker manager
====================================

Stevedore<sup>[1](#namefootnote)</sup>

1: Provide a simple local UI For docker management on macOS. In particular make it visible if things are running or not, so you don't accidentally leave lots of things running.

2: Provide a warm up project for me to learn Swift with. This means it does more than it should in terms of own code (e.g., a partial HTTP Response parser), but the point was for me to experiment with Swift as much as it was to make a tool that stopped me wondering where my battery had gone.

This code is released under GPLv3. Please see LICENSE.txt for details.
