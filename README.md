Stevedore: Simple local docker manager
====================================

Stevedore<sup>[1](#namefootnote)</sup> is a simple status bar item that indicates when you have locally running Docker containers and lets you start/stop them simply. This makes it harder to accidentally leave a bunch of Docker containers running on your laptop such that you then wonder later why your battery went down so quickly.

You can download a compiled version the releases on the github page.
